# CHATGPT SUGGESTIONS FOR TOP FEATURES
EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_3 → external risk scores; usually the strongest predictors,
DAYS_BIRTH (Age) → younger clients historically have higher default risk,
AMT_CREDIT, AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_GOODS_PRICE → loan size, repayment burden, and ratio features (credit/goods, annuity/credit),
AMT_INCOME_TOTAL + ratios with credit → affordability and debt load relative to income,
DAYS_EMPLOYED → stability of employment; very short or very long values matter,
REGION_RATING_CLIENT / REGION_RATING_CLIENT_W_CITY → region-level socioeconomic proxy,
OBS_30/60 & DEF_30/60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE → defaults in the client’s social network are strong behavioral proxies,
CNT_CHILDREN, CNT_FAM_MEMBERS → family size as financial pressure.
NAME_INCOME_TYPE, NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE, NAME_FAMILY_STATUS, NAME_HOUSING_TYPE → socioeconomic descriptors, help capture segments.
OCCUPATION_TYPE, ORGANIZATION_TYPE → type of job/employer, signals income stability.
DAYS_REGISTRATION, DAYS_ID_PUBLISH, DAYS_LAST_PHONE_CHANGE → recency of ID/phone changes can flag instability.
Credit bureau request features (AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_*: HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MON, QRT, YEAR) → recent inquiries are good predictors of credit hunger and correlate with higher risk.
FLAG_OWN_CAR, FLAG_OWN_REALTY → asset ownership, modest predictors.
WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START, HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START → weak on their own, but models may pick up patterns.
